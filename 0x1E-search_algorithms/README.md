## Description

In this project, we explore different search algorithms, including linear search, binary search, and more. Each algorithm is implemented in C, and the project provides a comprehensive understanding of how these algorithms work.

## Files

- `0-linear.c`: Implementation of the linear search algorithm.
- `1-binary.c`: Implementation of the binary search algorithm.
- `2-O`: Text file containing the time complexity of the algorithms.

## Usage

To use the search algorithms, you can include the relevant function in your C program. For example, to use the linear search:

```c
#include "search_algos.h"

int main(void)
{
    int array[] = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};
    size_t size = sizeof(array) / sizeof(array[0]);
    int target = 3;

    int result = linear_search(array, size, target);
    printf("Index of %d: %d\n", target, result);

    return 0;
}
```

## Compilation

To compile the search algorithms, use the provided Makefile:

```bash
make
```

This will generate the necessary executable files.

## Testing

To test the algorithms, run the provided test files:

```bash
./0-linear
./1-binary
```

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome! Please fork the repository, make your changes, and submit a pull request.
