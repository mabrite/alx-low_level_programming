# Project Title: 0x1C-Makefiles

## Overview

This project focuses on understanding and implementing Makefiles, a build automation tool used in software development. Makefiles are particularly useful for managing the build process of large projects, compiling source code, and handling dependencies efficiently.

## Introduction

The 0x1C-Makefiles project provides an exploration of Makefiles in the context of software development. Makefiles are configuration files that contain rules and dependencies to automate the process of building and compiling code. This project serves as a resource for learning and implementing Makefiles in your own projects.

## Usage

To use the Makefiles provided in this project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/0x1C-makefiles.git
    ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

    ```bash
    cd 0x1C-makefiles
    ```

3. Explore the provided Makefiles and associated source code.

## Files and Directory Structure

- **`Makefile`**: The main Makefile containing build rules and commands.
- **`src/`**: Directory containing the source code files.
- **`bin/`**: Directory where compiled binaries are stored.
- **`test/`**: Directory containing test files.

## Makefile Commands

- **`make all`**: Build the entire project.
- **`make clean`**: Remove compiled binaries and object files.
- **`make re`**: Remove compiled binaries and object files, then rebuild the project.

## Examples

Here are a few examples of how to use the Makefile commands:

- Build the project:

    ```bash
    make all
    ```

- Clean the project:

    ```bash
    make clean
    ```

- Rebuild the project:

    ```bash
    make re
    ```
